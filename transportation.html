		<fieldset style="background-color:antiquewhite;">	
		<p>Public transportation is so easy, convenient, and reliable in Japan. You have fast trains, metros, buses, and trams that will take you everywhere you like. This is also helpful since not all driver's licenses are recognized there.<br>
			However, we would not recommend renting a car either way. It is more expensive, and you can't fully enjoy everything around as you can without a car. We discovered some nice gems by walking around and using public transportation.
